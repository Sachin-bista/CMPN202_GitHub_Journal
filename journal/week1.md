In Week 1, I explored the basic commands and configurations of the Ubuntu system installed on VirtualBox.

## Tasks Performed:
- Checked system information using `uname -a`
- Displayed memory usage using `free -h`
- Retrieved IP address and network info using `ip addr`
- Verified OS version with `lsb_release -a`
- Checked disk space with `df -h`
